# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Your Task

This project started with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and was refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.


1. Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. This application is deployed to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:

### Technical Acceptance Criteria:

	* Has an Apollo Server that uses GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

	* Use an Apollo Server and apply it to the Express.js server as middleware.

	* Include schema settings for resolvers and typeDefs as outlined in the homework instructions.

	* Modify the existing authentication middleware to work in the context of a GraphQL API.

	* Use an Apollo Provider so that the application can communicate with the Apollo Server.

	* Application must be deployed to Heroku.
